            At some point in the past, a small snippet of sunlight reflected on
            a glass window frame and inspired an idea to publish intriguing,
            creative, and lovely books. An idea that burst into light and
            initiated the operation of what is now known as Tufail Publishers.
            Tufail Publishers believes in quality first â€“ we believe that books
            are better understood when they are accompanied by pictures and
            stories. For us, publishing is all about bringing out the best in
            students, through our acclaimed educational books and innovative
            workbooks.
